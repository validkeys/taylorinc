h2. URLs

h2. Setting up the environment for local development.

I highly recommend you use the following articles to setup your environment. You end up with a very clean system, and the ability to update your libraries to the latest versions without waiting on mac port compiles etc.

* Install MySQL if you don't have it already. "http://hivelogic.com/articles/installing-mysql-on-mac-os-x/":http://hivelogic.com/articles/installing-mysql-on-mac-os-x/
* Install the latest version of Ruby, RoR, MySQL, Git, etc. "http://hivelogic.com/articles/ruby-rails-leopard":http://hivelogic.com/articles/ruby-rails-leopard

h3. Running the application.

* Use the git clone url / command listed by github for the project.
* cd to the app dir you cloned to.
* sudo rake gems:install
* rake db:create
* rake db:migrate
* rake db:fixtures:load
* rake friendly_id:make_all_slugs
* ./script/server
* Go to "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 or "http://localhost:3000/admin":http://localhost:3000/admin
