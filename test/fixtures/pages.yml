  body: |
    The Teknion exhibit designed for IIDEX, Toronto 2007, has won Gold in the 22nd Annual Exhibit Design Awards.
    In planning the expanded 3,400 square foot exhibit; the first objective was to express Teknion’s ecological commitment to sustainability. Using sustainable materials and emphasizing Teknion’s long-term commitment to sustainability addressed the first objective. The primary wall treatment is an organic pattern that is C&C cut from panels made of recycled post-industrial waste. The treatment is opaque and yet provides translucency; the effect is modern, but with traditional allusions to nature. 
    The second objective was to create a compelling space in which to highlight two new products District and Marketplace. The overall palette created a neutral backdrop to exhibit these new product offerings, while avoiding visual clutter.
    The ceiling is made from a spandex type stretch fabric made from 90% polyester and 10% lycra. Great care was taken to use recycled and recyclable materials throughout, as well as sustainable wood and wall finishes.
