    The goal was to create a branded experience for Wigwam Mills, celebrates its 100 years of history, and to evolve their standards for merchandising displays and sales performance for at least the next decade. Taylor was asked to create a memorable experience through storytelling. Some of the key stories, used to distinguish and differentiate Wigwam included its legacy, technology, performance and people. The largest obstacle in the space was the inclusion of four distinct sales stations each requiring a complete sample set from current and future catalogues which included hundreds of products. Each station had to accommodate three customers and up to two sales reps with specific sales targets and goals for each show.

    The Best of CES Award winning exhibit for
    BEST USE OF TECHNOLOGY
    BEST BOOTH
    "Booth visitors swiped their CES badges at registration areas and were issued branded RFID cards. If a BlackBerry technology partner's demo or product piqued their interest, they were invited to hold their cards up to any of 44 access points throughout the booth. At the end of that day, attendees received emails from just the partners that interested them. The strategy put attendees in control of their experience, delivered interested leads to partners without any backend data sorting, and gave BlackBerry marketers rich information about who attended, when and for how long. A beautiful booth that was smart on the inside, too. An EM favorite."
